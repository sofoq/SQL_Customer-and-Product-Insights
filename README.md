# Data Analysis Reports: Customer and Product Insights

This repository contains two separate data analysis reports based on the same dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding **customer behaviors** and **product performance** within the context of sales data.

## Table of Contents

- [Customer Report](./CUSTOMERS%20REPORT/)
- [Product Report](./PRODUCTS%20REPORT/)

The analyses in these reports provide insights into customer preferences, buying patterns, product performance, and key sales metrics.


# Customer Report

This report is designed to analyze customer behavior based on sales transactions and demographics. By exploring various customer attributes, we can uncover purchasing patterns, identify high-value customer segments, and make data-driven decisions for improving customer retention and marketing strategies.

## Key Insights Explored

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on factors like frequency of purchase, demographics, and total spending.
2. **Sales Patterns**: Identifying trends in customer purchase behavior (e.g., peak buying times, average spending).
3. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimating the potential revenue from each customer over their lifetime.
4. **Customer Retention**: Understanding customer loyalty and the effectiveness of retention strategies.
5. **Product Preferences**: Identifying which products are most popular among different customer segments.

## Methodology

The analysis uses SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and segment customer data. Key techniques include:
- Grouping customers based on purchase history
- Analyzing customer demographics and sales frequency
- Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using aggregate sales data
- Identifying high-value segments for targeted marketing

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Used for data extraction, filtering, and aggregation. The analysis uses advanced SQL techniques such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and window functions to derive insights.
- **Power BI**: Used for visualizing customer behavior trends, including segmentation, spending patterns, and retention analysis (optional).

## Output

The report includes SQL queries to extract the relevant customer data and presents the following:
- Key customer segments
- Analysis of purchasing behavior over time
- Visualizations (if applicable) of customer trends and patterns

Please see the `customer_report.sql` for all SQL queries used in this analysis.



# Product Report

This report focuses on product performance analysis, identifying key trends in product sales, popular categories, pricing strategies, and product demand. The goal is to understand which products are driving revenue and which categories require attention.

## Key Insights Explored

1. **Product Performance**: Analyzing sales by product, identifying top performers, and evaluating product sales trends over time.
2. **Category Analysis**: Grouping products by categories and evaluating their performance in terms of sales volume and revenue.
3. **Pricing Strategies**: Assessing the relationship between product pricing and sales volume.
4. **Sales Volume Trends**: Understanding how product sales fluctuate by season, promotions, or other factors.
5. **Inventory Management**: Identifying products with low sales and recommending inventory adjustments.

## Methodology

The analysis employs SQL queries to filter and aggregate product data, utilizing techniques like:
- Grouping products by category and analyzing sales volume
- Calculating the average sales price and its impact on product demand
- Identifying product performance trends over specific time periods
- Using `CASE WHEN` statements for categorizing products based on sales data

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Used to retrieve, filter, and aggregate product sales data. Complex queries are used to identify trends and insights such as top-selling products, category performance, and pricing impact.
- **Power BI**: If applicable, Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards, providing visuals such as sales volume over time, top product charts, and revenue by product category.

## Output

The report includes SQL queries that provide the following insights:
- Top-selling products and their revenue contribution
- Product category performance analysis
- Visualizations (if applicable) showing trends in product sales, pricing, and revenue

Please see the `Products_Report.sql` for all SQL queries used in this analysis.
